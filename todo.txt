Debugging stuff:

1. Load and parse the multiboot memory map
2. Page frame allocator
3. Paging
4. Remap IO/whatever into sensible ranges
5. Write proper interrupt handlers

Medium-sized less immediate goals:
Basic scheduler - really quick and dirty, just to try out context switching and establish a thread data structure
PCI, ACHI
File system stuff
ELF parsing
Loader

Can we move the kernel base declaration into flags.h? Does that somehow work with the linker script?
