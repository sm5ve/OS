1. Page frame allocator
2. Some sort of rudimentary paging API
3. ELF loader (let's load a binary from the multiboot modules and try to run it as the kernel!)
4. Scheduler (multiple binaries?)
5. Ring 3

============== Important Gate ==============

At this point, the entire project should be
refactored, and split up more sensibly.
More care should be put into good and 
consistent naming, and an overall structure
and style should be decided upon.

This is my first big C++ project, and first
big programming project since high school,
so I have yet to learn good style/practices
for C++. This will be a major focus

I also would like to break some components
(Like ELF parsing, data structures) into
their own separate directories, to later 
function as userspace libraries as well.

Finally, at this point, a more concrete
direction for the project should be 
concieved, with a better understanding of
the sort of big-picture interfaces and 
concepts I would like to implement.

I am putting this off until after we get
to ring 3, as I have a fairly solid
idea for how I would like to do the VFS,
for example, but I want to be absolutely
certain I understand how the core
components of the OS interact with each
other before I try to come up with a good
collection of abstractions for them.
